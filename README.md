   ## Description
   This app takes a random assortment of users from the Random User API and provides you with some information that you might see in a list of employees in a directory. You will be able to sort the list of users alphabetically as well as by phone number in either Ascending or Descending order. You will also be able to filter the list to search for a specific user by name or phone number.
